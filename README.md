# Diabatic-Form-Automation
Diabatic form automation developed in pyhton using selenium and pandas libraries
This Python script automates the process of filling out a diabetic form using data from an Excel sheet. It reads patient information from the Excel file and inputs it into the form fields automatically, reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors. The script uses libraries like pandas for data handling and pyautogui or selenium for automating form filling, depending on whether it's a desktop or web-based form.
